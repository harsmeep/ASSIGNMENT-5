# ASSIGNMENT-5
In this assigment we have data drugs in which have dataset have data of various people of different ages male or female. it tell us about their BLOOD PRESSURE (BP), CHOLESTEROL and type of drug (MED) they are having. In this assignment we have performed Neural Network Algorithm and compared it to Logistical Regression Alogrithm  
# Getting Started
we have crested this assigment in python ( jupiter notebook ) in anaconda 
# Prerequisites
in this we will need anaconda navigator in a platform where different type of file are avaible and in we need to install jupiter notebook 
# installing 
once we have ibstalled anaconda navigator and install jupitor note next thing in to from an analysis. in this assignment we have performed Neural Networks. they re a machine learning framework that attempts to mimic the learning pattern of natural biological neural networks. Biological neural networks have interconnected neurons with dendrites that receive inputs, then based on these inputs they produce an output signal through an axon to another neuron.
# running of the test
first we have to intall the libraries important for the program

then after loading the dataset
then we have performed networaking. this image show the steps![github](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95315601/144723349-265a4166-af59-4d8d-8870-4aa0f0d583e0.png)
 
 
 after performing these step the output we got the result show correct are value were

the above the show the how presicised are value were to the real values
